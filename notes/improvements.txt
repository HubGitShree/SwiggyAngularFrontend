in the signup nd login page, the header and footer should not appear but tumhara aa rha hai because app.component mein daali ho,,how to recitify this?
To rectify this issue, you can use Angular's routing feature to conditionally display the header and footer components based on the current route. The standard way to handle this is by using Angular's `RouterOutlet` and defining different layouts for different routes.

Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Create a Layout Component**: Create a layout component that includes the header and footer.

2. **Update the App Component**: Use `RouterOutlet` in the app component to load different layouts based on the route.

3. **Define Routes**: Define routes for the login and signup pages that use a different layout without the header and footer.

### Step 1: Create a Layout Component

Create a new layout component that includes the header and footer.

```bash
ng generate component layouts/main-layout
```

In `main-layout.component.html`:

```html
<app-header></app-header>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
<app-footer></app-footer>
```

### Step 2: Update the App Component

In `app.component.html`, use `RouterOutlet` to load different layouts.

```html
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```

### Step 3: Define Routes

In `app-routing.module.ts`, define routes for the login and signup pages that use a different layout.

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { MainLayoutComponent } from './layouts/main-layout/main-layout.component';
import { LoginComponent } from './components/login/login.component';
import { SignupComponent } from './components/signup/signup.component';
import { HomeComponent } from './components/home/home.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: MainLayoutComponent,
    children: [
      { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
      // other routes that should include header and footer
    ]
  },
  { path: 'login', component: LoginComponent },
  { path: 'signup', component: SignupComponent },
  // other routes that should not include header and footer
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
```

### Summary

By following this approach, you can conditionally display the header and footer components based on the current route. This is a standard way to handle different layouts in Angular applications.
